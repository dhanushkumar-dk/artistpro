i want to create a well structured scheme for my music band artist collaboration hub project and the following is the features


use db:
{user_id, user_role, fname, lname, mail, password, country, state, instruments_array, description}


event db:
{event_id, image_url, artistname, eventname, month, date, time, bookingsCount,  location}

rental db:
{instrument_id, owner_user_id, user_name, instrument_name, rental_amount, location, status:(available/not in stock)}

community db: news, feeds and updates
{user_id, user_name, message, likes_count}

learning db: just same as community db

mytickets db: {user_id, user_name, event_id, } and structure more as you go
